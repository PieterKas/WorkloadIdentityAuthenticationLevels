1.  Introduction

   The Authentication Maturity Levels (AML) framework provides a
   structured approach for organizations to systematically assess and
   enhance their authentication mechanisms.  By offering standardized
   criteria and incremental levels of improvement, AML empowers
   organizations to progressively strengthen their security posture,
   ensuring that their authentication systems are resilient against
   evolving threats.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Workload Identity Authentication Levels

3.1.  Level 0: No Authentication

   Description: No authentication mechanisms are in place.
   Characteristics: Machines and workloads operate without any form of
   authentication.  No assurance of identity or integrity of dependent
   services.  Highly vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks.
   Examples: No access control or reliance on IP addresses combined
   allow lists and block lists for access control. ## Level 1: Deploy
   Time Shared-Secret Based Authentication Description: Manual deploy
   time of simple passwords, shared secrets and API keys without
   lifecycle management Characteristics: Use of simple shared secrets
   (e.g., passwords, API keys) deployed manually or at deploy time.  No
   unique identification of workloads Minimal automation in credential
   distribution typically without regular credential rotation.  Lack of
   instrumentation on credential lifecycle and governance reporting.
   Highly vulnerable to key compromise and lateral movement of
   attackers.  Examples: Deploy-time shared secrets. ### Level 2:
   Deploy-Time Credential Based Authentication Description: Static
   asymmetric key-based authentication and symmetric credential
   management systems that are deployed during setup.  Characteristics:
   Use of static credentials (e.g., long-lived certificates).  Minimal
   automation in credential distribution.  Basic security policies and
   procedures in place.  No reliable credential lifecycle management
   Often no governing authority for credential issuance, leading to
   issues such as password sprawl and difficulty in governance.
   Examples: Kerberos key tabs, long-lived tokens. ## Level 3: Automated
   Authentication with Static Credentials Description: Automated
   authentication using static credentials and improved logging.
   Characteristics: Use of static credentials (e.g., long-lived
   certificates, tokens).  Improved logging and monitoring capabilities.
   Automated processes for credential distribution.  Basic security
   policies and procedures in place.  Access controls tied to the
   credential rather than the subject of the credential due to the lack
   of an issuer/governing authority.  Examples: Automated API key
   distribution, long-lived certificates managed through automation
   tools. ## Level 4: Dynamic Authentication with Renewable Credentials
   Description: Dynamic authentication using renewable credentials with
   moderate automation.  Characteristics: Use of renewable credentials
   (e.g., short-lived certificates, tokens).  Automated credential
   issuance and renewal processes.  Enhanced logging and monitoring with
   anomaly detection.  Regular auditing and compliance checks.
   Examples: Short-lived tokens issued and renewed automatically,
   dynamic certificates. ## Level 5: Zero-Trust Principles with Context-
   Aware Authentication Description: Implementation of zero-trust
   principles with context-aware authentication.  Characteristics: Use
   of context-aware, short-lived credentials (e.g., ephemeral
   certificates, workload identities).  Continuous authentication and
   authorization checks based on context (e.g., behavior, location).
   Advanced logging, monitoring, and real-time threat detection.
   Integration with identity management and access control systems.
   Examples: Ephemeral certificates, workload identities validated
   against behavioral baselines. ## Level 6: Full Zero-Trust
   Implementation with End-to-End Security Description: Comprehensive
   zero-trust security with end-to-end protections.  Characteristics:
   End-to-end encryption and mutual authentication for all
   communications.  Full implementation of dynamic, context-aware
   authentication and authorization.  Automated security policy
   enforcement and compliance monitoring.  Robust threat intelligence
   integration and proactive threat mitigation.  Continuous improvement
   and adaptation to emerging threats and vulnerabilities.  Examples:
   Full zero-trust network architecture, real-time threat intelligence
   integration.  Naming and Attestation: Ability to identify the
   combination of machine and workload, with attestation providing
   assurance of the state of the environment.
